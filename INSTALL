To start using this application, you need the following dependencies:

    Solo: provides SingletonModel objects
    pip install django-solo

    South: provides database migrations
    pip install south

Then initialize the database:

    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate yeti_client

To run using the development server on port 8000:

    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Once running, you can access the application in your browser:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/yeti_client

For the admin interface:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

Like any Django application, this can also be run on any web
server, such as Apache or nginx, which should certainly be
used for production deployments.

That's it!
